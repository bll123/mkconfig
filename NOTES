Portability:
  'read varname < filename' was segfaulting/causing issues on some systems,
  so we work around it by saving stdin, opening the file on stdin,
  then using 'read' without the redirection.
  (Mandriva 2011/dash, Unixware 7.14).

  Tru64 sh has backslash interpolation issues.  See the test_echo function
  in bin/shellfuncs.sh.

  The set command has a wide variety of output formats.
    x=$'value'
    x='value'
    x=value

  Certainly not all of the information outlined in the autoconf docs is
  followed by mkconfig.  I have not run into some of their issues in my
  testing.  Some of their notes are perhaps for very old shells that no
  longer exist.  And mkconfig will not work without a shell that is
  modern enough to handle large amounts of memory.  e.g. sh on Ultrix
  fails.

Speed:
  bash is one of the slower shells.
  Avoiding useless use of quotes helps a lot.
  Also avoid opening and closing files all the time by using the numeric
   file descriptors.
