Portability:
  'read varname < filename' was segfaulting/causing issues on some systems,
  so we work around it by opening the file on stdin, then using 'read' without
  the redirection. (Mandriva 2011, dash, Unixware 7.14).

  Tru64 sh has backslash interpolation issues.  See the test_echo function
  in bin/shellfuncs.sh.

  The set command has a wide variety of output formats.
    x=$'value'
    x='value'
    x=value

Speed:
  bash is one of the slower shells.
  Avoiding useless use of quotes helps a lot.
  Also avoid opening and closing files all the time by using the numeric
   file descriptors.
